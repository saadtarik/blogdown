Hello, my name is Saad. I received my Master of Science in [Geological and Atmospheric Sciences](https://ge-at.iastate.edu/) from [Iowa State University](www.iastate.edu). Previously, I completed Master of Science in [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.umd.edu/) from [University of Maryland](www.umd.edu) and Bachelor of Science in [Water Resources Engineering](http://wre.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://buet.ac.bd/).

I am interested in geospatial and remote sensing data analysis and visualization for my career path. I am proficient in using supporting tools such as GIS, R, Matlab, and Python for analyzing and visualizing geospatial, hydrologic, climatic, and environmental datasets. I have used numerous ground- and satellite-based observations for my research and class projects. 

My other interests include traveling, photography, and gaming. You can find my travel photos in my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/saadtarik/) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/saad_gallery/).
